It has been no secret that UCSD have a shortage of space, both for housing and parking. The La Jolla Campus currently hosts 13678 parking spaces, and 22060 beds (after the completion of Pepper Canyon West). Which combined are still less than the currently 41065 of students enrolled in UCSD (according to 3rd Week Enrolment by UCSD IR department). To make this equation work, there must be students that are forced to take public transit or somehow get to school without occupying a parking space.

This should not be a challenge, as student are free to live around the campus and a (somewhat) good transit network surrounding the campus to commute. However, when the housing cost kept rising, off-campus housing becomes more and more unobtainable and most stakeholders in UCSD agree on the necessity for facilitating such a concern by building more on campus housing. As a result, UCSD currently boosted one of nation’s largest university housing inventory.

Though many sees the building spree as a triumph for students housing solution, not many people recognized that there are many drawbacks to it. For one, limited land resource creates conflict of land uses to house academic activities or the student population. When a student dorm was built, it is likely that an academic facility could not be built because of it.

Even more important than the space problem, is the capital cost involved onto building these facilities. The alarming rate of increase in debt means that the way and the pace that these capital project may not be sustainable and should be rethink upon. The Faculty Workgroup on Budget Priorities research shows from 2012-2019, there is a staggering 183% of long-term debt growth during that period and make UCSD to have one of the smallest debt load campus to the most outstanding long-term debt among all UC campus. 

Furthermore, since 2019, the debt has further risen by 15% to over 4.3 billion in 2022. For reference, in 2022, UCSD only generates 7.5 billion dollars of revenue, and has 11 billion dollars of assets. This means the university’s long-term debt is at over half its annually revenue, and over 35% of its assets. Not to mention that the university has been recording continuous deficit for since 2016 (even when factoring in non-operating revenue sources). Only in 2022, where there is a huge influx of total direct government grants helped changed the tide.

The scale of the debt could also be felt on the campus interest payments, Chancellor Khosla himself, when finding State support a zero interest rate capital funding, pointed out that every $100 million borrow equals to a cost of $2.1 million dollars of interest. This means that for the 4 billion debt, would result in 81 million dollar of interest payments annually. With the increasing interest rates today, albeit being a mere 2% of the entire budget, the current financial schedule shows UCSD is currently paying 169 million in interest alone in 2022, double of his estimate a year ago. As a reference, according to the Capital Budget Plan in UCOP, we only need $365 million dollars to build the 2 towers of the Pepper Canyon West Residential Halls. This means that interest paid every year equals to one 23-story residential hall tower.

These capital cost no only results in high interest cost that would need to repay in the yearly budget. It will also result in what Cummins, the former UCB vice chancellor predicted for the financial outlook for the Berkeley campus during the funding for the new stadium –“There would be an increasing number of students on campus, not enough professors to teach them, not enough classrooms to hold them and not enough beds for them. That would lead in time to a mediocre system.” In fact, we are seeing such an effect happening. Due to the fact that UCSD uses its auxiliary enterprise revenue to issue bonds for capital project, as a result of the downturn during the pandemic, HDH is forced to raise rate of over 80% to the graduate housing.

I agree that there is certainly a challenging housing need to accommodate. However, in my opinion, there are more ways that the school could address such, rather than focusing on a build plan, especially when it cost averages roughly $280769/bed (assuming the New Pepper Canyon rooms are single-occupancy as advertise). This cost double per bed of the UCLA’s Laurel, Palo Verde and Tipuana apartments.

With the extension of the Blue Line trolley, there were high expectation that it would allow students to live in places that they weren’t be able to live before due to constrain on travel mode. The stark reality is that the surroundings of the extension does not have enough housing resource, to allow further support of students, as it is aligned in between a freeway and single-family homes.

I believe drastic changes and decision must be made to solve this issue, and not a single solution alone would be Panacea of the housing crisis. One of the solution could be increase of parking availability, which would allow students to better afford the commute to lower rent. Another solution that would be possible, is the university should try to build from satellite campuses, which would allow a generally less density required as the land is cheaper. A satellite campus would also be able to further improve regional connectivity and climate goals, as it opens transportation options in car-dependent regions.

Just now, the University had announced that it would spend 1.1 billion of capital investment to build more dorms and a brand new Triton Center. I would just wonder the tide changes, does our campus would have enough reserve for the cold brutal winter?
