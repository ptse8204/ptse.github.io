# Edwin Tse
is a senior year undegraduate student currently at UC San Diego majoring in both Data Science and Business Economics, minoring in Urban Planning and Studies. Believe it or not, his biggest hobby is everything about urbanism (public transportation, land use etc.) He is actively working on his personal projects and finding work :).

His strong expertise across muiltiple fields, allows him to talk a lot more than usual comparing to his peers (send me an email let me entertain you with a fun zoom chat). Due to his hobby in urbanism, he is facinated with every transportation system that he travels and uses.
