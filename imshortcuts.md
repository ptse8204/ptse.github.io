So I made some iOS/iPadOS shortcut just that you don't need to think and remind yourself to say good morning/night to your babe. So, to use these, ensure your device has the [shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) app, and use the link below to add the shortcut to your device. Then, schedule a run time by using the automation feature (The "+" sign --> Create Personal Automation --> choose whatever automation you like), just make sure you turn off the "Ask Before Running" option. Also, make sure you add the message receipient on the bottom end of the shortcut as well.
